== Creating and Running the Suite

=== Creating the Suite

In the landing page, there are two options ```Load Suite``` and ```Create New```. 

We will look at saving and loading the suite in subsequent sections.

Clicking on the ```Create New``` navigates to the new suite page

image::new-suite-page.png[]

The ```New Suite Page``` displays the ```Suite Settings``` dialog

image::suite-settings-dialog.png[]

==== The Suite Settings Dialog

Fill the settings in the ```Suite Settings``` dialog, the description of which are as follows

* *Suite Name* - Provide the name for the suite
* *Server URL* - The base url to start the test with

The ```Browsers``` section displays the browsers on which the suite should be executed and their corresponding webdriver executables path, if selected.

[NOTE]
At least one browser should be selected for running the suite. Also, ```Safari``` browser is support only on the Apple macOS

* *User-Agent* - The user agent string to spoof the browser user agent, useful to automate mobile websites.

[WARNING]
The user-agent field cannot be set in Edge and Safari. Mostly works only wth Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome

* *Run Browsers Concurrently* - If checked, the browsers will be run concurrently, else they will be run in sequence.

[WARNING]
There could be unexpected behaviour if all the browsers are run concurrently because of memory, cpu wait, network latency etc. Though the webdrivers are run in separate threads.

=== Creating Scripts

Once the settings have been input and saved. We can start creating scripts. 

Click on the image:new-script-button.png[] button or kbd:[Ctrl+M] to open the ```New Script``` dialog.

image::new-script-dialog.png[]

To create a script the following fields have to be filled in the ```New Script``` dialog

* *Script Name* - Name for the script
* *Stop On Error* - Stop executing the script if checked, default is unchecked
* *Run* - Run the script, if checked.

Scripts in the suite can be choosen to run or not based on the ```Run``` being checked.

Once the details have been entered, a new script is created in the suite and a tab with the script name is created. In addition, there is also another tab names ```Scripts``` that lists the scripts in the suite

First let's see about the ```Scripts``` tab, before we see the details of actual script. The following image shows the ```Scripts``` tab

image::scripts-tab.png[]

The columns should be self-explanatory. There is a delete column that has icon:trash[fw] icon. Clicking on it deletes the script. 

[IMPORTANT]
Script once deleted cannot be undone.

Individual script tabs can be closed by clicking on the close button in the tab. Closed tabs can be reopened by clicking on the script name in the ```Scripts``` tab.

Individual scripts can be switched on/off from executing by selecting the ```Run``` checkbox

The script name can be changed by clicking on the Name cell of the script in the ```Scripts``` tab

Now let's see the Script Sheet Tab

Scripts shown in the ```Scripts``` tab will be executed in sequence based on the ```Run``` flag.

image::landing-page-script.png[]

A script contains a sequence of actions that will be executed by the WebDriver on the web page rendered by the browser.

By default, there are 20 rows added to the scripts sheet. To add more right click on the last row and add more rows as needed. Click the image:toolbar-one-row.png[] button in the toolbar for adding one row at the end of the spreadsheet. To add 10 rows at the end click the image:toolbar-10-rows.png[] button.

The script can be grouped in the two sections

* The Actions Section
* The Preprocess Section

The first two columns are the ```Run``` and ```Stop On Error```

[%header, cols="1,3"]

=== Running the Suite

Once the scripts in the suite have been prepared, clicking on the image:save-button.png[] saves the suite to the server memory. In addition, ```excelenium``` also validates the suite and if there any errors, it displays a dialog similar to the one below

image::errors-dialog.png[]

The errors dialog can be viewed again by clicking on the image:errors-button.png[].

Clicking on the image:run-button.png[] button, saves and validates the suite, and if the suite is valid it executes the suite on the browsers selected in the settings dialog.

Each browser will have a separate log file in its name along with the timestamp.

Also, the screenshots captured during the execution of the suite will be stored in the screens folder in the directory where the ```excelenium``` jar file is executed from.

Moreover the screenshots will be named based on the browser it is executed. For example, if the suite is executed on Mozilla Firefox, the name firefox will be appended along with the timestamp to the screenshot file name.
